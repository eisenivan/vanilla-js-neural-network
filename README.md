# Super simple neural network in JavaScript

## Getting started

Clone or download the repo. Then from the project directory in Terminal run this command. 

`node single-layer.js`

Feel free to experiment. Can you figure out how to add a second layer? If you have any questions Iâ€™m @banjoivan on Twitter.
